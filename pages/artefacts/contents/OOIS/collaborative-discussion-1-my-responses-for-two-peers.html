        <p>The Knight Capital incident teaches us a lesson. If the new developed system has inadequate tests, the system can causes a huge losses in a very short period. In this case, it caused $440 million dollars losses in only 30 minutes. One of the testing strategies is setting up a sandboxed environment which imitating the same configuration as the production environment for testing the behaviours of the new developed systems/features (Techopedia 2020). Before launching the new developed system/feature to the production environment. The QA team engineers should conduct tests and observe the behaviour of the system/feature. Make sure the system has been implemented as expected. This technique is also called "black box" testing. </p>

        <h3>My response to Kei Yiu Yvone Chan's post</h3>
        <p>The clinical management system (CMS) has had no hot-standby backup plan since the first system failure in August 2020. The CMS serves thousands of citizens in a day. The CMS is a mission-critical system. It means that when the system fails, it will affect thousands of patients and get postponed for treatments. Luckily, the emergency services had not got affected during the system failure accident of the CMS. But it illustrates that the Hospital Authority (HA) has had no follow plan since the last accident. They have got a very poor at the information system management. Jack (2020) introduced that one of the common techniques is setting a hot standby redundancy architecture for missing critical systems. It is no doubt that a reliable system should always react seamlessly with zero service downtime. The HA should take action to set up a hot standby system for the CMS to reduce the influence of medical services.</p>
