      <h3>Feedback from my tutor</h3>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>The selection of classes is exhaustive, and represents a sensible approach to the system. However, there are a significant number of classes that have been inserted into the scenario. For example the manager isn't mentioned in the brief anywhere. It is important to remember what is discussed in the lecturecasts etc. - at this stage you are merely designing, not implementing. The inclusion of singleton classesand the like is leaning more towards actually implementing.</li>
          <li>The relationships are good and in line with the system. Again as with classes you have inserted things into the brief that were not necessarily there.	</li>
          <li>States and behaviours are okay but lacking some depth. I felt that this was a section that needed more work.</li>
          <li>Great application of inheritance and composition that have been used appropriately.</li>
          <li>Reasonably well presented but a little small - try to make sure the documents are large and easy to read.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Evaluation of this assignment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This assignment was a great chance to practice what I learned throughout this module, such as identifying relationships among classes and utilizing object-oriented characteristics to design the class diagram for an imagined object-oriented information system. Also, I can put my thoughts on a graph with the Visual Paradigm design tool. </li>
          <li>As a software developer, I have few chances to design an object-oriented information system in the first place because I usually focus on developing information systems. Consequently, the class diagram design is too "implementing" and not designing as the class diagram contains too many details.</li>
          <li>In the future, I will improve my design skills based on my tutor's feedback. I should remove unnecessary details from classes. So, the class diagram wouldn't contain too much information on it.</li>
        </ul>
