      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 2 - Summary Post</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>During this collaborative discussion activity, we analyzed the fictitious case about Abi who is a scientific researcher, assisting the manufacturer to conduct a nutrition test for their new cheerio product. In my initial post, I reviewed concerns of the case on ethical, legal, and social aspects.</p>
      <p>In the social and ethical perspective, as a researcher, Abi should unveil all findings to the public due to public interests. I provided the case (Debras, C. et al. 2022) to which conducted vast investigations in a large-scale population-based NutriNet-Sante´ cohort about the relationship between consuming the artificial sweeteners and being diagnosed with breast cancer and obesity related cancers, to support this point of view.</p>
      <p>In addition, in the legal perspective, the Government of Canada urged that any research involving human and public interests should be reviewed by the Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Research Ethics Board (REB) before publishing.</p>
      <p>Bee Teck (2022) agreed that Abi should not have any bias in his report. He also pointed out an interesting point about misinterpreting research results whether it is deliberate or not, it will lead to wrong ways and insights for researchers. Therefore, taking biased not just affecting the results in his report, it also affecting the future studies.</p>
      <p>Nitin (2022) agreed that the legal rules can get rid of the challenges raised from ethical and legal concerns for the government and health groups, but these rules don’t help much about resolving food risks and foodborne illnesses. Furthermore, he provided a case study about the food safety of a baby milk which was produced by the German company Humana, causing three deaths and 17 people suffering from developmental disorders. From this case, we can see that the legal regulations are important to ensure food safety for the public.</p>
