      <h3>Re: Yvone's initial post</h3>
      <p>Hi Yvone, you analyzed Abi's case precisely. I do enjoy reading your post. I agree with your point of view that the researcher should present both sides of results and as a researcher should not be biased when drawing conclusions about their findings. </p>
      <p>Pannucci, C. J., & Wilkins, E. G. (2010) introduced citation bias which is one of bias after a trial, pointing out that researchers are reluctant to reveal adverse results because it reflects defects of the product. In this case, Abi as a researcher should reveal all kinds of results while evaluating a new cereal product. Otherwise, it affects the outcome of the report. In addition, to achieve an accurate scientific study, the researcher should not take any type of bias and prejudice. A biased study should be treated as an inaccurate study (ResearchArticles.com 2019). </p>
      <p>In my opinion, the researcher should be honest and be held accountable for releasing every scientific study. Even though the results might bring negative impacts to the manufacturer, it is essential to conduct the evaluation ethically and to communicate the results honestly.</p>

      <h3>Re: Brandon's initial post</h3>
      <p>Hi Brandon, your post was an interesting post and analyzed concisely. You introduced a new point of view to me, when analyzing the same data set, different researchers might come up with varying results and conclusions. Also, the manufacturer might violate the law by spreading misleading information and anticipate deceptive marketing activity without mentioning negative results of their products.</p>
      <p>In Canada, partially disclosing information in the advertisement can be treated as violating the Competition law. No matter being knowingly or recklessly about making false or misleading representation, this is prohibited by the government of Canada (Government of Canada, 2022). As a result, it is wise for researchers to stay away from participating in these kinds of activities, and indeed, presenting all findings is the best way to keep distance and maintain the integrity of scientific studies.</p>
