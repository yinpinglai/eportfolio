      <h3>Re: Babatunde's initial post</h3>
      <p>Hi Babatunde, thank you for your post. It was a great post about leveraging ethics and professional conduct in computing and censorship for spreading knowledge with technology.</p>
      <p>I agree that every industry has its regulation and discipline code of ethics, and each practitioner is recommended to follow it. However, I am worried about the overused censorship of legitimate subjects that is an obstacle for children to pursue knowledge and discover the truth.</p>
      <p>Reading and exploring exciting topics is an excellent way to grow and learn for children. However, suppressing those materials is a behaviour to restrict children’s imagination and discover the knowledge by themselves (Laura A. 2014.). Furthermore, the censorship system didn’t provide adequate information for those affected participants, violating the public interests. Therefore, computer professionals should maintain a good obligation about privacy and ethical programming while preserving the transparency of the data when involving the public interests (Schwieger & Ladwig, 2016).</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the controversy of using censorship technology and reducing its usage will be continued and discussed, and there is no absolute truth to this topic. I would recommend computer professionals review the ethics code for their developed systems to maintain transparency regularly.</p>

      <h3>Re: Mohamed's initial post</h3>
      <p>Hi Mohamed, thank you for sharing this case study and listing out related violations of the ACM ethics principles. </p>
      <p>The workplace abusive behaviors are a severe problem in society and we should not overlook it. In this case study, the superior shouting, yelling and bullying verbally to his coworkers. Those behaviors violate several ACM principals and bring uncountable harm to the victims in direct and long-term effects, such as anxiety and feeling stressed while staying in the workplace. Also, they might suffer from establishing relationships in the society (Merecz D. 2009.) Therefore, we should create a safe and protected area for coworkers to circumvent being bullied in any activity, no matter physically, phycologically or mentally. It is recommended that all superiors and managers should treat every coworker equally and fairly. Furthermore, in case witnessing any workplace bullying behavior should report it to the human resources and management staff immediately. (Gahanna O. 2017.)</p>
      <p>To sum up, any abusive conduct should be prohibited in the workplace. I think not just the computing professionals should follow it. All employees are also required to do so.</p>
