      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
      <blockquote>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies" target="_blank">ACM</a>).</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.</blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>The ACM and BCS code of conduct are guidelines for assisting computing professionals in building up an ethical working culture and promoting the ideal behaviours of reacting to ethical issues occurring in the workspace. </p>
      <p>In this post, I would like to share the dark UX patterns case study. The Dark UX patterns are the design that takes advantage of users by providing misleading instructions deliberately (acm.org, 2018). For example, buying additional expensive protection plans for your new smartphone, but customers don't notice these are optional with an intention to do that (Nerdwriter1, 2018.).</p>
      <p>The case study describes a scenario of making change requests for their client's e-Commerce website. Clients asked them to change the site's navigation behaviours and hard-noticing text colours. The developer doubted the design because of the confusion, but his manager still requested that he do it for clients. After that, the developer heard about the clients gaining significant increments in their revenue because of user error.</p>
      <p>The case study provides analysis by applying the ACM code of ethics. In this section, I would like to compare the ACM code of ethics and the BCS code of conduct.</p>
      <p>In addition, the misleading text colour shows their disrespect towards the visual impairment users. Therefore, this action can be treated as discrimination against a specific user group and violates the ACM Code of Ethics Principle 1.4 (acm.org, 2021) and BCS Code of Conduct Section 1 c (bcs.org, 2021).</p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>The developer doubted the design, but he still did that as this was his job and his line manager insisted. So, I would suggest the following actions for him to deal with that.</p>
      <p>First, express your concerns to the senior manager. As IT professionals, it is our diligence to discover underlying impacts and ensure the system produces quality outputs for the public. Then, the developer can raise it, let them minimize the consequences, and negotiate it with clients.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the developer can also blow the whistle to the public as the requested changes will affect the public interest and create discrimination against visual impairment users. Therefore, the developer has a choice to do so and gets protected by the whistleblowing law in the UK (Department for Business Innovation & Skills, 2015.), and the employee cannot dismiss them unfairly.</p>
