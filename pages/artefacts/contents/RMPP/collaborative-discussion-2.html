      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 2</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>In this discussion, we will explore the impacts on legal, social and professional aspects.</p>
      <p>The review of the nutrition is not just a work for a researcher, it also influences the public interests. Debras, C. et al. (2022) conducted vast investigations in a large-scale population-based NutriNet-Sante´ cohort about the relationship between consuming the artificial sweeteners and being diagnosed with breast cancer and obesity related cancers. The investigation results revealed that over-intake of the artificial sweeteners can raise 13 percent of developing those cancers. In addition, the authors also reviewed related studies in animal experiments, and discovered a similar relation between artificial sweeteners and the risk of cancer. Therefore, from the social perspective, the research results are also important for the public because it might affect the public’s health and developing cancers.</p>
      <p>A professional researcher should not take any side of revealing the results. In this case, Abi is reviewing a new cereal for the Whizzz manufacturer, and he is going to not reveal the downside of the statistical results. Being biased to any condition, it can affect the final result of the report. Therefore, Abi as a reviewer, should not choose any side for reviewing the result. He should present the truth based on whatever he found from the statistical results.</p>
      <p>When research involves human and public interests, it should be reviewed by the Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Research Ethics Board (REB), and get certified by PHAC and REB. The goal of the reviewing process is to ensure the research meets the ethical standards (Government of Canada 2019).</p>
