      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Compromising a Medical Mannequin - Summary Post</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>I received two responses from Thien Liu and Sathira Padukka. They both provided comprehensive advice on possible mitigation methods for dealing with threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the initial post.</p>
      <p>Thien Liu introduced the Principle of Least Privilege as one of the mitigation methods for preventing unauthorized and unauthenticated access. Debbie W. (2020) indicated that organizations should apply the Principle of Least Privilege by granting minimal access rights to users to accomplish the goal of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). For example, when developers must access application servers to view application logs, then only grant the read permission for them instead of giving the root privilege. That means developers couldn’t modify and delete the files in the production environment. It prevents the modification of the critical configuration files accidentally.</p>
      <p>Sathira Padukka introduced three mitigation methods for preventing DDoS attacks. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The server redundancy method – By setting up the server redundancy architecture, DDoS attacks will be separated and handled in multiple servers instead of one server. This method can reduce the response time for regular requests. </li>
        <li>The limit of networking broadcasting method – By limiting the broadcast forwarding between terminal devices, DDoS attacks will be interrupted. This method can eliminate the extent of DDoS attacks and prevent sending malicious requests to legitimate addresses.</li>
        <li>The monitoring network traffic method – By monitoring the network traffic, if the network team observe a high volume of requests in a short period, they can get an adequate reaction time in dealing with DDoS attacks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To sum up, those methods are worthy of trying to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities for preventing being compromised for a Medical Mannequin system. The system can apply the Principle of Least Privilege to restrict access for accessing, tampering, and retrieving unrelated data, such as the access point information of the system. Also, there are different strategies to mitigate the attack by sending malicious flood requests to the system, such as the server redundancy method, the limit of networking broadcasting method, and the monitoring network traffic method.</p>
