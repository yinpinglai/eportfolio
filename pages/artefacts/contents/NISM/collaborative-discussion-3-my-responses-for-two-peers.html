      <h3>Re: Thien's Post</h3>
      <p>Hi Thien,</p>
      <p>Thank you for sharing this case study. I found your suggestions are great to mitigate this issue and keep the DPA in compliance.</p>
      <p>According to article 33(1) of GDPR (2016.), the data controller should notify the supervisory authority of every data breach incident within 72 hours after aware it happened. In this case, I couldn't see the hospital had notified the supervisory authority until the complainant had reported it to the Information Commissioner's Office. The Spanish Data Agency (2019.) recommended setting up an incident management system to manage incident cases better and document the incident activity details before notifying the supervisory authority. I would suggest setting up this system for better incident management.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the root cause of this incident was human error. The staff mismatched the address of the General Practitioner and the patient. Even though hospital administrative staff had taken serval actions, this problem might still exist and happen in the future. So, to eliminate this problem, I think this workflow can be automated to reduce the chances of mismatching addresses for different parties. For example, the staff can print the recipient's address by the computer system and stick the address on the envelope without hard writing it. It might help minimize human error. Do you think automating this workflow can be helpful for this case?</p>

      <h3>Re: Sathira's Post</h3>
      <p>Hi Sathira,</p>
      <p>Thank you for sharing this case study. Your proposed suggestions effectively mitigate the data disclosure problem and keep the organization in DPA compliance.</p>
      <p>In this case, I saw the staff had disclosed personal data from a child. According to article 8 of GDPR (2016), the data controller collects consent from those under 16. Therefore, they will need to obtain the content from the parent or guardian. So, I would suggest that the Department of Social Protection implement the age-verification mechanism in their existing systems when obtaining consent from those under 18 (European Commission N.D.). For example, verifying the ID card for the data subject to ensure the data subject doesn’t need consent from the parent or guardian. Also, I would add a part to the employee training programme to emphasize and improve awareness when obtaining consent from a child. </p>
