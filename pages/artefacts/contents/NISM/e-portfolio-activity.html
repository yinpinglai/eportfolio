    Read the following articles on Kali Linux:
    Leroux, S. (2020) The Kali Linux Review You Must Read Before You Start Using It.
    It's FOSS. Available from: https://itsfoss.com/kali-linux-review/

    Bhatt, D. (2018) Modern Day Penetration Testing Distribution Open Source Platform - Kali Linux - Study Paper.
    International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research 7(4): 233-237.

    - What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?
    - What issues might you encounter?
    - How would you overcome them?

    Bhingardeve, N. & Franklin, S. (2018) A Comparison Study of Open Source Penetration Testing Tools.
    International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development 2(4): 2595-2597.

    - How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?
    - What do you think of their criteria?

    “Kali Linux is a well-respected collection of open source pen testing tools,
    including metasploit, nmap, wireshark and sqlmap amongst many others.
    It has the benefit of being available as a ‘live distro’ which means that there is no requirement to install it – it will run from a DVD or a USB/ thumb drive.
    For these reasons, we recommend that Kali Linux is the tool of choice for this assignment.” (UoEO Computing Team, 2020.)

    Based on your evaluation in the previous session and the articles above, consider the recommendation given above:

    - What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?
    - Has this changed your original evaluation score?

    <h3>Questions for the Bhatt, D. (2018) article</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?</b><br />
        <p>It teaches me to how to perform reconnaissance activity for the target remote machine, such as domain, sub-domain and open ports information. It also demonstrates how to compromise the remote system to acquire root access to the target system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What issues might you encounter?</b>
        <p>
          The Kali Linux only set up a default user "root" for us at the beginning. It is dangerous to perform any action on your machine. The Linux system won't check the permission for the root account. So, if we run any test with the default root account, it would damage the system and resulting in become unbootable. (Leroux, 2020).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>How would you overcome them?</b>
        <p>
          Runs the Kali Linux by using the virtualization technique to avoid running it as my main operation system. It isolates my main operation system from the Kali Linux. It also provides a way to persist a snapshot at anytime. So, it can be recovery to the last good condition (Bhatt, 2018). 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Questions for the Bhingardeve, N. & Franklin, S. (2018) article</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?</b>
        <p>
          In the article, the evaluation results for those tools are quite simple and it doesn't elaborate much in the article. It provides simple indication for the comparison item.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What do you think of their criteria?</b>
        <p>
          I think the evaluation results are not comparing those penetration tools. For example, the SQLmap is the only tool for exploiting SQL injection to the target system. I think we should compare with the similar tools to see the differences among same type of tools.
        </p>

    <h3>Questions for the UoEO Computing Team, 2020 statement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?</b>
        <p>
          <b>Pros for using Kali Linux:</b><br />
          1. Free and open source.<br />
          2. It bundled with a verity of tools, and easy to use.<br />
          3. Flexible. It allows to add options when using those penetrating test tools.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Cons for using Kali Linux:</b><br />
          1. Requires a high computer specification to use the virtualization technique to host it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Pros for using Nessus:</b><br />
          1. Easy to install. It can be installed on Kali Linux.<br />
          2. It good at performing vulnerability scanning for the target website.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Cons for using Nessus:</b><br />
          1. It is not a out-of-box tool to perform vulnerability scan by only one click. Users have to set up the test environment before performing it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Has this changed your original evaluation score?</b><br />
        <p>No. The Kali Linux is a free, easy to use, and a out-of-box tool for conducting different scanning and testing. It can install the Nessus tool to perform vulnerability scanning.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
