      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 3 - GDPR Case Study</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The prosecution of AA Ireland Limited is the main subject of this case study. The DPC received a complaint in December 2017 that AA Ireland Limited had sent unsolicited marking materials and messages to the complainant without getting consent. AA Ireland Limited admitted that they had done the above to the complainant during the investigation. AA Ireland Limited also admitted that they had acknowledged the complainant and should not use his personal information for any commercial purposes. Eventually, AA Ireland Limited claimed that it resulted from human error.</p>
      <blockquote>What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?</blockquote>
      <p>This case study addresses the aspect of getting explicit consent for using the collected personal information. According to article 22(2) of the GDPR (2016.), the data controller must obtain the data subject’s explicit consent before using any collected data. However, in this case, the AA Ireland agent didn’t ask any questions about getting consent from the complainant.</p>
      <blockquote>How was it resolved?</blockquote>
      <p>In 2018, AA Ireland Limited entered a guilty plea to one offence. It also agreed to cover the prosecution costs incurred by the DPC. The Court applied Section 1(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act in lieu of a conviction and fine. (DPC, n.d.)</p>
      <blockquote>If this was your organization, what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</blockquote>
      <p>If I were an Information Security Manager for this organization, I would take the following steps to mitigate the human error issue.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Provide training programmes to agents to improve their awareness of collecting personal data, data privacy, and the consequences of violating the GDPR.</li>
        <li>(ICO. 2018.) recommended that the company should keep those proof of consent records before sending any direct marketing communications. So, I would set up an auditing mechanism to verify the user’s consent before direct marketing.</li>
      </ol>
