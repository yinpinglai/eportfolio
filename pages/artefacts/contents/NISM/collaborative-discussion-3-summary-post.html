      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 3 - Summary Post</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p>I summarized the prosecution of AA Ireland Limited and provided serval suggestions to mitigate the issue in my initial post. The complainant had requested serval times to AA Ireland Limited to stop sending messages. However, AA Ireland Limited ignored his requests and kept sending messages to him until the complainant reported the case to the DPC. Finally, AA Ireland Limited confessed the offence of the Probation of Offenders Act. (DPC. N.D.). The AA Ireland Limited admitted it was caused by human error. </p>
      <p>I discussed this with my classmates Thien and Sathira. I noticed that the human error still was the root cause from their case studies. I observed that the problem was the clerical error from Thien's post. Staff mismatched the patient and the General Practitioner's addresses. As a result, I recommended that to mitigate that issue by automation to reduce the chances of human errors. In addition, from Sathira's post, I noticed that the GPDR requires the data collector should pay attention to obtaining consent, particularly from children. Consequently, I suggested that Sathira consider establishing an age-verification mechanism for handling getting consent from those under 18.</p>
      <p>Throughout the above case studies, human error was the main reason. An employee fault caused 88% of data breach incidents, and only 12% were identified as malicious attacks (Tessian 2022.) To address this problem, we can provide training courses to educate employees and let them understand the consequences of data breaches. Also, monitor employee activities regularly to detect any malicious activity. (Ekran System 2019.)</p>
