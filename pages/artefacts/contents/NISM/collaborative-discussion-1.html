        <p>The authors conducted three experiments in the paper and revealed threats and vulnerabilities on demonstrating compromising a Medical Mannequin system. We will discuss major threats and vulnerabilities in this post and give mitigation for the corresponding threats and vulnerabilities in the final section.</p>
        <h3>Major Threats</h3>
        <p>The brute force attack can ascertain the access points' information with unauthorised access. By injecting the BrackTrack tool into the system, attackers can access the terminal without authorisation. After then, attackers use the Reaver to do the brute force decryption of the Wi-Fi access point information.</p>
        <p>Attackers can reject authorised users accessing the system by conducting the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. By inserting the MAC address of the authorised application to the blacklist, the system refuses all requests from the accepted application. As a result, the accepted application can no longer access and configure the system.</p>
        <h3>Major Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>The system doesn't have any protection for the root account. As a result, attackers can access the root account and type any command with the root privileges. For example, attackers can modify the blacklist of restricted MAC addresses of the system with the root account permissions.</p>
        <p>The system uses not strong enough cryptographic algorithm to protect the passphrase of the Wi-Fi access point information. For example, attackers can crack the passphrase with a brute force attack. In addition, attackers can ascertain the encrypted information quickly.</p>
        <h3>Mitigation for threats & vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Set up a strong enough and complex password for the root account. Esheridan (N.D.) pointed out that a complicated and prolonged password can increase the time of cracking it with a brute force attack. Also, Brooke B. (May 2021) recommended that the passphrase be at least 15 characters in length with combined multiple wordings. Undoubtedly, a lengthen and not easy to guess password can increase the complexity of cracking it with the brute force attack.</p>
        <p>Set up monitoring tools to keep watch all network traffic in the network. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (May 20) suggested that organisations monitor unusual network traffic and usage by configuring monitoring tools. Monitoring tools like Uptime Boot and PingDom keep watching any unusual network traffic and the availability of the services. If any suspicious network traffic or service is inaccessible, they will alert the network management team.</p>
