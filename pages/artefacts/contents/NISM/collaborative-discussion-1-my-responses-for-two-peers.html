        <p>Apart from disabling the WPS functionality of the Wi-Fi access point, there are other ways to protect it as well. For example, Dmitry E. (2018) identified one of the vulnerabilities of the Wi-Fi access points. Attackers can perform brute force attacks to ascertain the passphrase of the access point and propose underlying mitigation to alleviate this problem by setting up the rare limit of the Wi-Fi access point. Setting up this configuration of the Wi-Fi access point imposes the limit of authorization attempts on it. When attackers exceed the limit of authorization attempts, the Wi-Fi access point will disable the WPS functionality. Another underlying solution is using the enhanced WEP security to protect the connection between the access point and devices proposed by Dimitris Z. (2012). It consists of serval steps while establishing the connection between the access point and widgets, such as entering the randomly generated number exchanging public key and session symmetric key. As the randomly generated number is shown on the screen, users need to get it from the screen. Thus, attackers are challenging to perform attacks because they need to be physically present in the victim’s home.</p>

      <p>Regarding the brute force attack on the wireless access point, several studies have been conducted. MohdYusof M. (2014) provided and demonstrated two mitigation techniques to prevent brute force attacks on the passphrase of the wireless access point. One of the techniques is changing the time of broadcast intermission of the wireless access point. It impedes the flooding of brute attacks as the target access point is temporarily unavailable. So, attackers couldn't generate contiguous attacks. Another technique is mapping the allowed devices' MAC address to the access point. It enables the list of Mac address devices to access the wireless access point. All devices not in the allowlist will filter out and deny requests from those devices. The IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) method can also be applied to prevent brute force attacks. Empirical experiments have been conducted and proved in Mohammad I (2020) 's study. When attackers attack one of the systems in the network security system, it will log the IP address of the attacker into the collector database. All other servers will ignore all requests from this IP address as those are malicious. It will ban and restrict gaining access to the network security system.</p>
