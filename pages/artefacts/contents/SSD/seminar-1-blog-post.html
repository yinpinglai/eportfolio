      <p>Human factor becomes the most of root cause of leading security breaches. IBM (2014) reported that over 95% of the security incidents were identified as “human error”. We always focus on defending ourselves from the outside world, but the inside world is being overlooked. If the system is without proper security management for your organization, it will become vulnerable and assailable from being attacked by insiders. So, we discuss strategies against cyber security attacks from insiders.</p>
      <h3>Access Control</h3>
      <p>Access control is the process to determine whether users are authorized to access protected resources or not. It verifies users’ credentials by asking for username and password and the identity of valid users. However, B. Mahesh Babu and Mary Saira Bhanu (2015) pointed out that even if the inputted user’s credentials are accurate, the system still can be abused by an unauthorized person. As a result, they proposed an emerging way of identifying users’ keystroke behaviour to reinforce the access control mechanism to mitigate this problem.</p>
      <h3>Audit</h3>
      <p>Setting up a mechanism to audit employees’ actions enables them to investigate and trace every change made by employees. For example, if an employee changes a record that is vital for the system, the system will make it down to the log file. Once the auditor finds any illegal modification, it enables the system to recover the record quickly.</p>
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>Authentication is the first step to verifying clients’ requests for most systems. First, the system receives the client’s request. It then examines whether the request is sent from recognized users or not. If the request is invalid, it will refuse to proceed with the client’s request.</p>
      <h3>Monitoring</h3>
      <p>Using monitoring tools is one of the techniques against cyber security attacks from insiders. Chris S. (N.D.) recommended that it warns system administrators to react to any unusual user activity immediately. As a result, it can reduce the damage to be minimal. For example, if system administrators find any suspicious activity, they can suspend the employee account right away.</p>
      <h3>Policy</h3>
      <p>Restrict security policies and procedures help detect and prevent attacks from insiders. The investigator can follow policies and procedures to look into any suspicious user activity. If employees break any policy, they need to confess their misuse to the system.</p>
