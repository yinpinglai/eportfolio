      <h3>Re: Sathira's post</h3>
      <p>Hi Sathira,</p>
      <p>Thank you for your sharing. </p>
      <p>You organized and summarized the findings of the iSEC team, which was very remarkable for other readers to understand the problem of TrueCrypt flaws quickly. </p>
      <p>For the ontology design, If I were you, I would add a sub-column next to each vulnerability and categorize them by their severity. I think adding the severity for each vulnerability could be helpful for readers to realize how important it is. Also, it is better to utilize the ontology design to address the flaws information for the TrueCrypt software intuitively. </p>
      <p>In the final section, I saw you were not recommending it to your friends. I also would like to share some alternatives with you. Next time, you can provide an alternative for your friends and assist them in making a better choice on doing the data encryption. For example, we can utilize the BitLocker, which is created by Microsoft and free to use on the Windows platform. It also supports advanced encryption standards. It mainly supports full-disk encryption to protect your entire computer and not just individual files. It also works for encrypting a virtual drive or other volumes that you can view and access like other drives on your computer. (Rob G., 2022.)</p>

      <p>Hi Babatunde,</p>
      <p>Thank you for your sharing. </p>
      <p>I found your post excellent in discussing the problems for the TrueCrypt software deeply and very informative.</p>
      <p>I also saw this post suggest an alternative such as the VeraCrypt. However, the post didn’t mention it much. If I were you, I would make the comparison between TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt. To demonstrate why considering the VeraCrypt software would be a better choice than the TrueCrypt. I found a post comparing the VeraCrypt and TrueCrypt software. There are serval significant differences among them. For example, it compares the installation speed for an encrypted disk, the prevention of brute force attacks, and community support (CyberYozh security group. N.D.). In addition, I think it is better to list out all vulnerabilities with the ontology diagram because it can represent them clearly and easily read.</p>
