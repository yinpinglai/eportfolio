      <h2>Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h2>
      <hr />

      <blockquote>
        <p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is a scientific method for measuring the quality of code. The calculation of cyclomatic complexity (CYC) computes all paths of the function. A Higher CYC means that the function is complex for testing. Conversely, the lower CYC implies that the function has well test coverage and is easier to test.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the Cyclomatic Complexity is an objective way to measure the developed function with emotionless. I worked on many legacy projects with some functions containing a thousand lines of code in a single function. I am not the original author of that function. It took me a lot of time to examine the logic of the developed function. It is also difficult for me to make a change for those functions because there are a few unit tests to support them. If the function breaks down into serval functions, it facilitates other developers to study or make a change for them.</p>
      <p>I would recommend the developed function to keep the complexity of CYC below 5. It reduces the cost and complexity of future maintenance.</p>
