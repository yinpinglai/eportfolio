        <p>Thanks for your sharing. Those two case studies are pretty impressive to me.</p>
        <p>For the first case, I have the same views as you. I believe source code management and testing are essential for a successful project. You proposed automating testing to ensure continuous testing, which is a suitable methodology. Developers often forget stuff even though they had written the program. I also suggest using Git technology to manage the source code for better code management. A well-documented source version control can be easier to track all changes made for the project, and it is much easier to revert to the last stable version (Atlassian, N.D.). If developers make mistakes and pollute the code base, they can roll back to the previous commit in a convenient way (Brent Laster, 2018.). Do you think it is a good idea to manage the code base using Git?</p>

        <p>This is a great article and thanks for your sharing.</p>
        <p>The Boeing 737 Max accident is a heartbreaking tragedy in the recent history of aircraft accidents. I agreed that this accident was caused not just by technical failure but poor management as well. Another problem for Boeing was focusing on making profits and putting safety behind. The engineers were undergoing pressure from their managers. So, they cheated safety regulations and put larger fuel-efficient engines on old aircraft. (Terence M., 2020)</p>
        <p>I understand that cost and budget control are vital parts of project management. However, in this case, I think the passengers' safety would be the top priority rather than taking passengers' lives in danger. As Boeing is one of the major aircraft manufacturers in the world and there are still a lot of air crafts flying in the sky. </p>
