      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Summary Post</h2>

      <p>Project management is a trip leading all perspectives toward the success of the project's goal. It focuses on planning, management, communication, and organization to meet the defined objectives. (Association for Project Management, 2015) The project manager defines the precise objectives of the project, estimates required resources, executes the project plan, and monitors the entire life cycle of the project. (Shira B. J., 2022.)</p>
        <p>Project management is crucial because it leads the way to the project's destination for all parties. Proper project management provides a brunch of benefits for the organizations, such as alignment on strategies, objectives concentration and reducing costs. If an organization doesn't have proper project management, it will lead to project failure due to project overruns, lacking objectives, running out of budget etc. (Master of Project Academy, N.D.).</p>
        <p>I reviewed my first and peers' posts, and we had different reasons and views on the same case. Take the project failure case of the Airbus 737 as an example. In Yvone's post, she provided three reasons of causing this project's failure: lack of testing and poor communication. (Kei Yiu Yvone Chan, 2022.). While from Sathira's post, he indicated that the main reason of causing this project's failure was poor decision-making by the management staff. (Sathira Padukka, 2022.) Therefore, I think a project failure has multiple reasons and gathering all reasons would be caused a bigger problem.</p>
        <p>To sum up, excellent project management can reduce extra resources and control and monitor the risk of the project efficiently. We can see that if we execute a project with poor planning and management, it will cause a fatal error, such as an aircraft accident of the Boeing company.</p>
