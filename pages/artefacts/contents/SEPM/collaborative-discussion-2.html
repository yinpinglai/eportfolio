          Human emotions can affect the user experience, a fact which contributes to the complexity of user satisfaction with a product. Further complicating the process is the fact that user emotions on the first use of a product are likely to be different to their emotions once they become more experienced. <br /><br />
          Read Minge & Thuring (2018). Based on the change in human emotion over time, might you adapt Figure 1 in their paper in any way?<br />

        <p>The user experience can be affected by human emotions. Humans usually get affected by the vibe, feelings, and knowledge while deciding. For example, you might buy unwanted clothes because of a good-looking outfit during shopping. Humans sometimes make decisions based on psychological experience rather than physical needs (Nate Girard, 2020).</p>
        <p>Humans have different feelings about the product during various stages. At the beginning stage, humans decide based on the product's apparel. After then, humans might change their minds before the product's utility at a further stage (Minge and Thüring, 2018). Take purchasing unwanted clothes as an example. People might regret using it after a few times because it doesn't fit them or its price is too high.</p>

        <p>Figure 1 depicts the relationship between non-instrumental and instrumental qualities and how they are affected by human emotional reactions. However, the human emotional response can be influenced by other aspects such as the person's educational background, financial affordability, and peer reviews. For example, when purchasing a new electronic device, most people will consider the cost-effective of the device. Still, other people might think about the device's brand and design. So, the educational background and financial affordability also affect their experience with that device. Therefore, I would include these criteria in the CUE model.</p>
