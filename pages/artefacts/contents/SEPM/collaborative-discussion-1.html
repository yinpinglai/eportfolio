      <h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Project Failures Study</h2>
      <hr />

        <p>Please read the Lehtinen et al. (2014) paper and then answer the following questions:</p>
        <blockquote>What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?</blockquote>
        <p>Lehtinen et al. (2014) performed the root cause analysis for those project failure cases from different perspectives, such as sales manager, project manager, and development team. Sometimes, there is not only one cause for the project failure case, and it might cause by multiple causes. The most common reasons for project failure which caught my eyes are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No schedule for software testing (Quality related failures)</li>
          <li>Workload estimations were not done (Estimation and analysis-related failures)</li>
          <li>Features are more important than the quality (Skills and competency failures)</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).”</blockquote>
        <p>One classical project failure case is the accident of launching three-ton satellites into orbit. The rocket exploded after 39 seconds of launch. After the European Space Agency investigated and found the reason for this accident, it was caused by a programmatic mistake. The computer programmer tried putting a 64-bit number into a 16-bit length variable. Consequently, the integer overflow problem happened (Gardner, D., 2011). This project's failure is due to lacking skills and experience in testing and having code quality control. Developers and testers should identify this common error during the testing phase, but they didn't. </p>
        <p>Another classical project failure case is the failure of planning and time estimation of replacing the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advanced Automation System. The procurement process and requirement specifications were chaotic because they were ambiguous. It also wanted to implement a "Big Bang" change to replace the existing obsolete system in a short period. As a result, the FAA and Congress have been blamed, and the Information Technology Management reformed the Clinger-Cohen Act to improve the government acquisition (Bar-Yam, Y., 2003).</p>
        <p>The above two examples show the imperative parts of requirement gathering, procurement preparation, and system testing for every project. I choose those three common causes of project failures because I realize that those failures often occur in various projects.</p>
