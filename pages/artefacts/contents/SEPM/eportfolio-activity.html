      <blockquote>Question: As a Project Manager, what might be your response to manage the emotional reactions of a customer? You should use at least three academic papers to support your response and write a minimum of 300 words as your response.</blockquote>
      <p>The components of the User Experience Model (CUE) (Van der Linden et al., 2019), which was created by Thüring and Mahlke (2007), elicit the "Perceived instrumental qualities" and "Perceived non- instrumental qualities" affect emotional reactions taken by customers. These components produce a significant influence on the "Emotional reactions" component.</p>
      <p>From the observation of the CUE model, the customers' emotional responses will be influenced by either the usability or the aesthetic of the product. For example, if the product is too buggy and can't fulfil customers' expectations, customers might feel unsatisfied with the product. As a result, the interaction with the faulty product might generate a poor user experience. </p>
      <p>As a Project Manager, I would comfort customers at the beginning. Indeed, if customers express negative emotions through the complaint, it is better to settle them as the priority. After that, I would take a step back and think about the following activities we can take to improve our product. (Andrew D., 2001) proposed that we can take an evaluation with the following three levels apart from the usability for the product: "process", "outcome", and "affect" because these areas are often disregarded in the recent decades' UX design.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, these areas also affect the user experience of customers. For example, suppose the customer has taken action to complain about the product. In that case, it means the process and the outcome cannot fulfil the customer's satisfaction with the instrumental and non-instrumental qualities of the product. Consequently, I would evaluate with the customer to find out the root problem of the product, and we can take follow-up action to enhance our development for a better user experience.</p>
