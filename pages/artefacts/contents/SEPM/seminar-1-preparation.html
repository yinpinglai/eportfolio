      <blockquote>Selected example: Using a new coffee making machine</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Your response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver and so on. Be prepared to share your scenarios at this week's seminar. You can test your Gherkin scripts in the Behave engine. </blockquote>
      <pre>
      Scenario 1: Make a coffee by using a new coffee making machine (User's perspectives)
        Given that the coffee machine has enough coffee beans to make an americano
          and the coffee machine is in the standby mode
          and ready to make a coffee
          When a user clicks the button for making an americano
          then the coffee machine runs the predefined procedures to make an americano
          and the coffee machine starts to fill the cup
          and the level of coffee beans and water are reduced
      </pre>
      <pre>
        Scenario 2: Make a coffee by using a new coffee making machine (Administrator's perspectives)
           Given that the coffee machine is running in low coffee beans level
             and the indicator of low coffee beans level is lighted up
            When an administrator clicks the button for making an americano
            then the coffee machine refuses to make an americano
            then the buzzer starts to alert the user to fill in coffee beans to the minimum level
             and an administrator fill in coffee beans to the coffee machine
            then the coffee machine runs the predefined procedures to make an americano
             and the coffee machine starts to fill the cup
             and the level of coffee beans and water are reduced
      </pre>
      <pre>
        Scenario 3: Make a coffee by using a new coffee making machine (Administrator's perspectives)
        Given that the coffee machine is running in low water level
          and the indicator of low water level is lighted up
         When an administrator clicks the button for making an americano
         then the coffee machine refuses to make an americano
         then the buzzer starts to alert the user to fill in water to the minimum level
          and an administrator fill in water to the coffee machine
         then the coffee machine runs the predefined procedures to make an americano
          and the coffee machine starts to fill the cup
          and the level of coffee beans and water are reduced
