      <p>I learned a lot of things throughout this course. The object-oriented information system module provides theory, concepts, and chances to practice my learned skills in designing, implementing, and evaluating information system solutions. Those formative activities were a precious experience for me to participate in the entire development lifecycle. As a software developer, I seldom participate in the design phase. Instead, I usually focus on implementing the information system. So, I am glad to share my learning journey in the following sections.</p>
      <p>The object-oriented information system module consists of concept theory and practical activities. It provides the concept of the information system, the object-oriented principles, the concept of the UML design, and the database design principles. It also offers many formative activities, such as discussion with peers and designing and developing an object-oriented information system. Throughout this module, I demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and design techniques by doing formative activities and assignments.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the journey, it introduced a brunch of concepts. The main components of the information system consist of data, people, information, and process. We discussed an incident on the information system failure. I realized that if a system launched without conducting enough tests, it can cause tremendous and unimaginable losses on money, lives, and even the company's reputation. [1] Apart from the failure on coding, some incidents were caused by humans, such as the information system is being obsoleted without proper regular maintenance [2] and laid off too many IT department staffs who understood a complete blueprint of the system [3]. Consequently, when I develop a new system, I will have comprehensive tests on my codes before releasing them.</p>
      <p>The second station was the object-oriented principles and design concept. I learned about the differences between classes and objects. Classes are the boilerplate of the object, whereas objects are class instances. I also learned the object-oriented design concept, such as inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and aggregation. I have applied this concept to design the class diagram for the online supermarket in unit 3's practical activity. [4] I feel confident creating a new system because this knowledge and techniques empowered me.</p>
      <p>The third station was the database concepts and modeling. I learned the three normal forms of normalization(3NF). Normalization is the process of dividing data set into the proper table design. The first form is to eliminate duplicated rows in the same row. The second form is assigning an attribute to be the primary key. The third form is making sure that the data in the same table rely on the primary key, not reply on transitive dependencies. During the practical activity in unit 7, I designed proper table structures to solve the existing table structure problem by using three normal forms of normalization. [5] I can use this technique to design table structures for a new system in the future confidently.</p>
      <p>The fourth station was discovering the trend of NoSQL database technology. I learned that there is a brunch of types of NoSQL databases in the market. We identified characteristics among different NoSQL databases, such as key-value databases, document databases, and graph databases. [6] I realized that relational and NoSQL databases are not an either/or relationship. They serve different purposes. For example, relational databases are designed for hosting on a single powerful machine, whereas NoSQL databases can host on distributed machines in the network. As a result, when we select the database, we should consider the size of the data set and the way how we store the data set.</p>
      <p>The last station was the implementation practice for an information system. I learned the key concept of the model-view-controller when building a web application. The model is responsible for manipulating the data with the database. The view is responsible for presenting the page to clients. The controller is responsible for handling clients' requests. I applied this concept to my system implementation assignment. [7] Apart from the MVC model concept, I also learned various programming languages while implementing the information system, such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML. I can demonstrate my skills through this assignment. In the future, I will explore other design patterns for implementing a web information system, such as MVP and MVVM patterns.</p>
